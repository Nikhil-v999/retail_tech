## 📋 Executive Summary

DealDrop is an **AI-powered hyperlocal marketplace** that connects local retailers with nearby consumers.

- Uses **Machine Learning** for dynamic pricing according to expiry date and demand (velocity)
- Recommends related items for customers according to their wishlist
- Uses **geospatial algorithms** to ensure customers only see deals that are physically accessible within a short timeframe
- **Reduces wastage** of products and increases retailer revenue
- Provides customers with **discounted local products**

---

## ❗ Problem Statement

- Retailers **cannot clear** near-expiry or overstocked inventory
- Customers are **unaware** of nearby deals
- **No real-time** hyperlocal discovery system exists

**Result:**
- Lost revenue for retailers
- Missed savings for customers

---

## ✅ Proposed Solution

DealDrop introduces a **Hyperlocal Relevance Engine**:

- **AI-Driven Pricing** — Automatically calculates optimal discounts
- **Geospatial Discovery** — Shows only nearby deals
- **Recommendation System** — Recommends related items for users according to their wishlist
- **Relevance Score Algorithm** — Ranks products intelligently while showing to the user

## 🤖 AI Dynamic Pricing Model — FlashMap

**Model:** Gradient Boosting Regressor

**Input Features:**
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `days_left` | Days until deal closes |
| `stock` | Units remaining |
| `velocity` | Sales speed (units/day) |
| `store_tier` | High / Med / Low traffic city |
| `category` | Dairy / Snacks / Electronics etc. |
| `demand_type` | Essential / Normal / Luxury |

**Output:** Optimal discount percentage (0% to 85%)

> Currently uses simulated training data. After real-world usage, the model will retrain on actual sales data stored in the database.

**Fallback Formula** (when model unavailable):
```
> 24h left  →  10% OFF
12–24h      →  25% OFF
6–12h       →  40% OFF
< 6h        →  60% OFF
```

## 📍 Geocoding Infrastructure

- Uses **OpenStreetMap (Nominatim API)**
- Converts addresses to **Latitude & Longitude**

| Node | Location Type |
|------|--------------|
| Retailer | Fixed — set at registration, never changes |
| Customer | Dynamic — can update anytime |

---

## 📐 Haversine Distance Formula

Used to calculate the real-world distance between customer and store:

```
d = 2R × arcsin( sqrt( sin²(Δφ/2) + cos(φ1) × cos(φ2) × sin²(Δλ/2) ) )
```

Where R = 6,371 km (Earth's radius), φ = latitude, λ = longitude.

---

## 🎯 Relevance Score Algorithm

Deals shown to customers are ranked by:

```
Score = 10 + (50 × Discount%) − (10 × Distance_km) + (30 / Days_Left)
```

**Insights:**
- Nearby deals rank higher
- Urgent deals rank higher
- Balanced discount prioritization
- Base score of +10 ensures all products remain visible even with 0% discount

---

## 🔄 System Workflow

**Retailer Side:**
1. Add product to inventory
2. ML model predicts optimal discount
3. Launch deal — goes live instantly to all nearby customers

**Customer Side:**
1. Opens app
2. Sees deals ranked by relevance score
3. Views recommended items based on wishlist
4. Visits store and buys
